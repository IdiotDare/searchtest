# searchtest

AYO BUDDY FRIEND I NEED A SEARCH BAR
1. This is a test for some searching functions.
2. Just a test. I still have to learn CSS.
3. But this is for a future project of mine.
4. I think this could help.
5. VW is the name so far.
6. Kind of like a database?
7. I still dont know what it's going to be, n or vn.
8. But that's alright.
9. I think Im going for like, 1000 words a week.
10. Probably not a day, as that'll wear me out.
11. Maybe 2000 words?
12. Hmm.
13. 500 a day?
14. That'll be 3500 words a week.
15. And since I'll pretty much be doing it on weekends, 1750 a day.
16. Which is defintely too much.
17. I'll stick to 1400 words a week, 200 a day, 700 a day on weekends.
18. Actually, let's jump that down to 1000.
19. Yeah, 1000 is fine.
20. If I can do more, then I will.
21. Nah, actually, make it 1400.
22. Yup yup.
23. Although actually, I still have to world build, so that's a pain for later days!
24. Im adding that to my world count. Im literally coding, dude.
25. Sigh, maybe I can have the info in like, markdown.
26. And then I can learn the rest of responsive web design.
