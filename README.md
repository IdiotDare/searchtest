# searchtest

AYO BUDDY FRIEND I NEED A SEARCH BAR
1. This is a test for some searching functions.
2. Just a test. I still have to learn CSS.
3. But this is for a future project of mine.
4. I think this could help.
5. VW is the name so far.
6. Kind of like a database?
7. I still dont know what it's going to be, n or vn.
8. But that's alright.
9. I think Im going for like, 1000 words a week.
10. Probably not a day, as that'll wear me out.
11. Maybe 2000 words?
12. Hmm.
13. 500 a day?
14. That'll be 3500 words a week.
15. And since I'll pretty much be doing it on weekends, 1750 a day.
16. Which is defintely too much.
17. I'll stick to 1400 words a week, 200 a day, 700 a day on weekends.
18.
